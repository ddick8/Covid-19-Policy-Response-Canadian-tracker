# CovidPolicy-Canada
A timeline of Covid-19 mitigation policy in Canada and select regions outside Canada. 

CovidPolicy-Canada gathers information on common public health measures for each province and territory in Canada. This information can assist in understanding government responses in every province across Canada. Public policies implemented by governments recorded on a scale from 0 to 3 to reflect the degree of restrictions. For full descriptions of the restrictions and their corresponding values refer to our [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/ddick8/CovidPolicy-Canada/blob/main/Data%20Dictionary.md). 

Information on public health measures in each province/territory was gathered using government and news websites. [Provincial Measures Timelines](https://github.com/ddick8/CovidPolicy-Canada/blob/main/Mitigation%20implementations%20timelines.xlsx) reports timelines of restrictions for every province.  Using these timelines and data dictionary, provincial CSV file was created. [Provincial CSV file](https://github.com/ddick8/CovidPolicy-Canada/blob/main/Provincial.csv) reports province/territory and degree of restriction implemented by government (on a scale from 0 to 3) on daily basis beginning on January 1, 2020 to present. The CSV file is being updated every 2-3 weeks. 

Format for Data Dictionary and CSV file on this page was adapted from Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. CSV file has dates in the following format: YYYY - MM - DD.
